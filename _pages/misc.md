# Misc 




**Pottery**  

One of my favorite hobbies is pottery, especially wheel-thrown functional ceramics (e.g., coffee mugs). I took lessons for many years at the [Hyde Park Art Center](hydeparkart.org) after very briefly getting hooked at the [Princeton Arts Council](https://artscouncilofprinceton.org/). I'm just now starting classes in the Bay Area.

**Running**

Since moving to the Bay Area, I've started trail running, I've been finding routes on [BA Hiker](https://bahiker.com/) and [Trail Stompers](http://www.trailstompers.com/), as well as just on the alltrails app. I'm not particularly quick, but I've enjoyed participating in some road races over the years, including the [Stanford Dish Run](https://web.stanford.edu/group/runningclub/dish.html), the [Princeton Half Marathon](https://www.princetonhalfmarathon.com/), and anything in Central Park hosted by [NYRR](https://www.nyrr.org/).

**Birding**

I'm a beginner birder, especially interested birds on either end of the size distribution. I have a feeder set up outside my window for hummingbirds, and even once managed to feed them from my hand. On the other end of the size distribution, I am a huge fan of [Cal Falcons](https://calfalcons.berkeley.edu/), I have been to the raptor migration at [Hawk Hill](https://www.parksconservancy.org/parks/hawk-hill), and I try to spot California Condors whenever possible. I got hooked by the [Merlin Bird ID app](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/), which is super helpful for beginners!

**NY Times Crossword Puzzles**

I try my best on [NY Times Crossword puzzles](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). Though I'm usually only able to solve Mondays-Wednesdays, I occasionally get lucky with a Thursday or Sunday. I like to lurk the commentary in the [Word Play](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/daily-crossword-column) column and on [Rex Parker](https://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/)
